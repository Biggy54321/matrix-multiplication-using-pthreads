# Matrix multiplication using pthreads

* The program performs matrix multiplication of two input matrices, either using the naive O(n^3) approach or using threading. The threading approach uses only three threads for performing the multiplication. This can be changed by updating the macro in the matrix.c file.

* The gen_mat.py can be used to produce a random matrix.
